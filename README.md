A **modern Gemini Clone** built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring a UI and secure backend integration via **Netlify Functions**. I actually made this project originally for highseas, thats why it took me less than 2 hours to make :D I have added alot of security features so that its actually safe to use now!
